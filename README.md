# 🐍 Python - Hello, World


## 📌 Description
This project is your first step into **Python** at Holberton.

Goal: get comfortable with the **Python interpreter**, basic **printing**, **strings**, and the common rules used in the curriculum (shebang, executability, file formatting, and style checking with `pycodestyle`).

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without Google):

- How to use the **Python interpreter**
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use **strings**
- What **indexing** and **slicing** are in Python
- What the official Python style guide is and how to check code with **pycodestyle**
